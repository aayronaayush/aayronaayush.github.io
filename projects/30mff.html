        <b>Description: </b> For this project I tried to keep the design as
        minimal as possible. I did not want to make the website or the website
        very happening as I wanted the user to focus on the main content of the
        page which would be whatever is displayed right after the navbar. For
        the same reason there is only one block of content displayed on the
        webpage at a time. Initially, the webpage would load with the film or
        the video as that is usually what the user or the viewer would mostly
        come to view.
        <br />
        I also tried to make the user experience as clean as possible by avoid
        the number of actions the user of have to take to view the different
        content. In this instance, the user would just need to click on the
        title of whatever they are tried to view to see the content and since
        the navigation buttons are nearby it is easy to find and use.
