        <b>Description: </b> For this project, we created a 6-panel interactive
        comic strip that showcases a day in the life of people with a mental
        health illness and how they cope with it. Each panel shows individual
        people doing different activities to take care of themselves and improve
        their mental health. The first panel starts in the morning when the
        person wakes up all the way to the last panel when they go to sleep. In
        the fourth panel, all of the characters from the rest of the panels are
        displayed together in a support group to show how they come together and
        discuss what they have been doing or what they are yet to do. This panel
        is interactive and alternates between the characters where each of them
        reflects on how they take care of their mental health. Under our theme
        of Mental Health Awareness, we aim to represent at least one specific
        broad idea or an aspect that helps improve mental health in each panel.
        Examples include owning your feelings, finding the positive, eliminating
        toxic influences, creating healthy routines, supporting others, and
        connecting with others. All of the panels are displayed in a sidebar on
        the left side of the screen on top of each other to show how the story
        flows and allow the users to move to the panel of their choice. The
        bigger, right side of the screen presents each panel individually and
        the user can scroll through to look at all the panels.
