        <b>Description: </b> For our project, we decided to walk the user
        through a murder mystery story that follows along an investigator
        interrogating 3 suspects for the murder of a woman that is closely
        related to them. We wanted to create an experience where the users are
        introduced to the murder and suspects through an investigation as
        opposed to explicitly telling them. Therefore, the users would be
        listening to the investigation as a means to piece together the
        different components of the characters surrounding the murder.
        <br />
        We wanted to create an immersive storytelling experience through sound
        and the website. Therefore, we made the story interactive by giving the
        user the opportunity to pick what character they want to skip to their
        part but also making it participatory by allowing them to choose the
        murderer. We also divided the story section into three main parts in
        order to ensure maximum interactivity and engagement with our story.
        Through the interactivity of the website and the engaging story, we hope
        to create an immersive online experience.
